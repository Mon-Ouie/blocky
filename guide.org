#+TITLE: A programmer's guide to Blocky internals


* Visual blocks


Blocks do differ from Lisp expressions in being modeled somewhat
loosely after physical objects. Each block has a spatial position in
the form of XYZ coordinates, and possesses further attributes of
height, width, and depth.

Despite the Smalltalk influence, Blocky does not aim to be a
hermetically sealed environment. Instead, everything is fair
game---users are encouraged to import whatever devices and API's they
desire into the Blocksverse by writing new blocks that wrap the
functionality.
