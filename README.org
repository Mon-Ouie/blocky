This is the README.ORG file for the Blocky programming language. It
contains general information about the project as well as an index of
important files in this source distribution. 

The included file "COPYING" contains full licensing information,
including the text of the GNU General Public License, Version 3.

See the included file INSTALL for installation instructions. A
programmer's guide may be found in the file GUIDE.ORG.

Blocky is a visual programming language for [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Lisp][Common Lisp]] paired with an
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs-like]] user interface. In addition to borrowing ideas from GNU
Emacs, the language design is heavily influenced by existing research
environments such as [[http://puredata.info/][PureData]], [[http://squeak.org][Squeak]], [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morphic_(software)][Self Morphic]], [[http://scratch.mit.edu][MIT Scratch]],
[[http://byob.berkeley.edu][Berkeley's BYOB]] project, and more recently Jens Moenig's [[http://www.chirp.scratchr.org/blog/?p=24][Smalltalk
Elements.]]

My ultimate goal is to create an industrial-strength object-oriented
visual Lisp by importing the "abstraction" concept from PureData. Such
a "visual Lisp macro" facility enables much more powerful blocks to be
defined in terms of simpler ones, interactively. In addition there are
some improvements, such as native [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL][OpenGL]] support throughout, and of
course the advantage of compiling your block diagrams to optimized
machine code via [[http://sbcl.org][SBCL]]. (Don't forget [[http://quicklisp.org][Quicklisp]] either.)

I also wish to enable unfettered inquiry into computable knowledge,
and to support radical autonomy of creative expression. So I have
built Blocky first and foremost /as a human language activity
supported by free software/, not as an app or platform---because
language is a human right.
