This is the INSTALL file for BLOCKY.

This file gives you instructions on how to download BLOCKY and
compile it from source code.

BLOCKY works on Windows and Mac, but compiling BLOCKY on those
platforms may require additional steps (such as installing the
included SDL binary DLL's in the included win32/ subfolder of the
BLOCKY source directory.)

More instructions for Mac and Windows will be available soon.

1. System Requirements (All Platforms)

    - A text editor (preferably Emacs or Vim;
      http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) If you use Emacs check out
      SLIME (you may need the CVS version) and if you use Vim check
      out SLIMV.

    - A Common Lisp implementation such as Steel Bank Common Lisp (see
      platform-specific notes below for suggestions on SBCL; CLISP and
      CCL have also been reported to work.)

    - A working OpenGL implementation. Hardware acceleration is
      strongly recommended. (Most fairly recent Mac and Windows
      machines will have OpenGL drivers already.)

    - Git, a distributed version control system client.
      http://git-scm.com/

1a. System Requirements (Linux)

   You need a recent release of SBCL, such as 1.0.47.24. You must also
   have the SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) libraries installed on
   your system. How to do this is beyond the scope of this
   document. See http://www.libsdl.org for more information.

   Your Linux distribution will most likely have SDL packages for
   sbal, sdl, sdl-image, sdl-mixer, sdl-ttf, and sdl-gfx, all of which
   are required for to compile BLOCKY. You may also need to install
   the sdl-*-dev packages corresponding to each.

1b. System Requirements (Windows)

   You will need a Windows version of SBCL from http://sbcl.org

1c. System Requirements (Macintosh)

2. If you have not already done so, download BLOCKY:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/blocky.git 
   
   If you need to use the development branch of BLOCKY, 
   do this: 
  
   cd ~/src/blocky
   git checkout develop

3. Then link the blocky.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   mkdir ~/.sbcl
   mkdir ~/.sbcl/systems
   ln -s ~/src/blocky/blocky.asd ~/.sbcl/systems/blocky.asd

4. Install Quicklisp
    
    http://www.quicklisp.org/ It takes only a few moments to install
    Quicklisp, and this is the best way to download and install all
    the Common Lisp libraries that BLOCKY depends on---automatically.

6. (OPTIONAL) Configure project folders

   The distribution contains a text configuration file called
   BLOCKY.INI; by default the executable looks for it in the same
   directory.

   To run projects, BLOCKY needs a line like this added to the INI
   file so that it will know where to find them.

  (setf blocky:*project-directories* '(#P"~/blocky/" #P"~/projects/"))

   The first item should be the pathname of wherever you installed the
   BLOCKY source tree. This is auto-detected as the current directory
   if you don't set it. NOTE: These must be pathnames (prefixed with
   #P) and must contain a trailing slash.

   The other directories should contain game projects. For example:

    mkdir ~/projects
    cd ~/projects
    git clone git://github.com/dto/xong.git

   Now that the example game "XONG" is installed, we're ready to go.

7. At the shell, cd to the install directory for BLOCKY, run SBCL, and
   then issue the following commands at the REPL one by one:

   ;; load dependencies via Quicklisp
    (map nil #'ql:quickload 
    	 '(:lispbuilder-sdl-mixer :lispbuilder-sdl-ttf :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx :lispbuilder-sdl-image :cl-opengl :cl-fad))

    ;; compile and load BLOCKY
    (require :blocky)

    ;; run the example
    (blocky:play "example1")  ;; or the name of any project in your *project-directories*
