* Overview

"Void Mission" is a sci-fi action roguelike divided into three
episodes. The action takes place in a 2-D pixeled future in which you
fly a transforming humanoid/jet suit in both exterior space and
interior environments while firing projectile and/or energy weapons at
enemies and simultaneously avoiding their fire. The story is largely
told through text, represented in the game as data files, emails, or
voice communications with a non-player character. Gameplay is tied
into the story with missions that require balancing combat with
exploration and puzzle solving.

Void Mission's game play is that of a rogue-like with simplified
controls. Only the four cardinal directions are available for movement
and firing, and the player can only carry or use a few (i.e. between 1
and 5) items at a time. The player also has fewer stats than in a
typical roguelike, but various upgrades make sure that character
development is still central.

* Controls					       :Controls:

  - Arrow keys (or numeric keypad) for player movement.
  - Shift-arrow for activating the selected inventory item.
    If this is a gun for example, you fire in that direction.
  - Z to change the selected inventory item
  - X for picking up items, activating switches, and so on.
  - C to drop the selected inventory item

** Default keybindings

The CALL method is not actually triggered by the shift-direction
keybindings. Instead, to obtain satisfactory behavior, the shift key
is polled every physics timestep. See the player's RUN method.

** TODO Joystick control

* The player 						 :Player:

The player is a human male who spends the entire game inside an Olvac
mimetic-plasteel exosuit, and can move freely between
interior and exterior scenes. This suit has two modes: humanoid mode,
in which the suit acts as an exoskeleton for exploring human-scale
environments, and a fighter mode with high-speed jetpack and wide,
micro-thin plasteel wings for space travel and combat.

The suit's energy shield is its sole defense; when SP (shield points)
drop to zero, you die. 

Character development comes in the form of upgrades such as additional
inventory slots, increased firing power, hit points, new weapons, and
so on.

*** TODO Draw exosuit 16x16 graphics (tweak Blast Tactics voyager stuff)

 file:gun.png

** TODO Design and write about upgrade system

* Mission structure 				      :Structure:

Gameplay is mission-based, with one mission leading to others in a
branching fashion. Each mission is self contained, and the player and
his inventory are all that survive a mission.

* The game world 				    :Environment:

Each mission takes place across one or more grid-based XE2 maps.

* Combat system						 :Combat:

The player can fire various bullets and beams at enemies, destructible
objects, and other targets. Bullets take time to travel to a target;
beams (usually energy weapons) are instantaneous point-to-point.

Energy weapons use up the energy points (EN) meter, and cannot fire
without sufficient EN. You can restore EN with Energy packs, or by
visiting an energy recharge station.

** TODO Import energy packs
** TODO Create recharge station

Shell based weapons have limited ammo, but do not require energy to
fire.

Some enemies are shielded from energy attacks, and require shell-based
weapons to defeat.

Various kinds of bombs and mines also exist. 

** TODO Import kickable bombs from CONS
** TODO Import seeking gravmines from BT
** TODO Create sticky bombs
** TODO Create grenade weapon, area effect explosion

* Setting 						  :Story:

It's 2061. If only there were enough endurium!

It's been known for decades that Humanity's reach within the Milky Way
is limited only by the supply of endurium, its rare and precious
fuel. The energy crises of C.E. 2021 and C.E. 2027-2031 caused global
economic, social, and environmental disruption, and with this
disorganization came the concentration of wealth and power in the
hands of the government and corporate elites.

Early attempts at control and regulation of endurium met with initial
success. The space-faring nations---Russia, China, India, Japan,
Brazil, and the United States---along with the ESA (European Space
Agency), could quite naturally claim endurium for themselves. But
economies of scale and espionage in spaceflight technology eventually
brought smaller deposits and endurium dust streams throughout the
interstellar neighborhood within the reach of multinational
corporations and various non-state actors. The largest of these formed
what they called a "sovereign", open, and successful market in
endurium, spaceflight technology, and various otherwise-controlled
materials. The split between the Spacefaring Nations on the one hand,
and the United Nations on the other, threatens to break into
full-scale interstellar war; as Earth's environment continues to
decay, the demand for endurium has reached a critical point.

* Plot

** Prologue

A new high-powered telescope operated by Xiomacs Corporation detects a
pattern of gas streamers radiating high in the ultraviolet, within a
cavernous void in galactic space. Subsequent observations show that
the streamers are emitted from a string of black holes. The
scientists, seeing the pattern's obviously artificial nature, guess at
a propulsion method being used to drive a spacecraft, and begin to
look for something at the trail's leading edge. A year later the
calculations fall into place: the source of the black holes is an
object about as massive as Jupiter, but much smaller and far more
dense. And it has been accelerating for 1.2 billion years by riding on
streams of gas being ejected from the black holes at relativistic
speeds. It is given the name DVO, for Deep Void Object.

#+end_src

**** TODO Corridor level
**** TODO Purple space with DVO visible at one edge as a curved planet surface (NASA)
**** TODO Dark neon Xianghua cruiser sprite

Long, narrow northward corridor with cloud walls and enemies.

Fight your way through the cloud and enter orbit around the DVO. You
discover a large Xianghua Industries cruiser already in orbit, a dead
hulk with no energy or life signs. At this point it becomes obvious
that you are not the first human to visit the DVO, and that at least
one other Corporation has reached orbit and possibly the DVO itself.

*** 1.3: Retrieve memory card

**** TODO High-tech interior

You must restore power to the Xianghua cruiser and retrieve a memory
card with a copy of the map. Once power is restored, security gates
will activate, and you must throw switches to turn them off. Once you
get the memory card, this is combined with new information (ancient
texts) possessed by Xiomacs. This helps Brennan choose an appropriate
landing site on the DVO.

** Episode 2

*** 2.1 Investigate landing site

You find yourself in a windswept ocean of grey sands with outcroppings
of black glass. This more ambient level involves radar searching and
some digging with charges, as well as a climactic boss encounter with
a big sprite :)

You find some supplies and a high-bandwidth transmitter at the
scattered camp sites of the previous expedition's landing.

After defeating this boss you may enter the DVO itself. 

*** 2.2 Investigate DVO origins and purpose

This level involves some tricky enemies and some tone-based puzzles,
giving the first hint at the Ancients' mindset and language. Square,
sine, and saw.

You discover the probe carries the last embryos and the encoded
knowledge of a dying species. The probe is automatically carrying out
its mission to escape a replicating, matter-rearranging mechanical
menace known as the Black Metal. The goal is for the probe to tear a
portion of the universe away from ours at the moment of the Heat
Death, so that the new universe and the old will be absolutely
causally unconnected; only in this way can the Black Metal be escaped,
and their race renewed. 

The Ancients calculated that the Black Metal would grow forever,
dominating matter and space without limit, and therefore all
information and energy. It would be the extinction of all life, and
eventually of all phenomena; a true Heat Death. (The metric expansion
of space and the DVO's great speed ensure that any pursuing Black
Metal objects could never reach the DVO.)

*** 2.3 Return to surface

You receive an urgent message from Brennan but he is cut off in
mid-sentence, something about getting back to the ship. When you reach
the surface, fighting many enemies along the way, the computer decides
to speak, and tells you that you've come 31 million years in the
future, and Brennan (and the rest of Humanity) are long dead.

** Episode 3

*** 3.1 Return to Void Rider

The computer explains that it just awoke, and cannot control its
malfunctioning defense systems (i.e. the enemies you have encountered
up until this point.) Furthermore, the entire mission is in danger,
because a tiny capsule of dormant Black Metal had been secretly
installed aboard the Void Rider, still orbiting the DVO and now slowly
being transformed. In fact the whole mission is a plot to take over
all the DVO's, a plot organized and executed by the Black Metal
itself, who manipulated Xiomacs Corporation through various human
contact personalities. By contaminating the DVOs with Black Metal, the
substance could survive and flourish in the new "tear-away" universes,
and enlarge its dominion to the total range of possible universes; a
dark consciousness that has absorbed literally Everything. The only
way to destroy the Void Rider is to steer it into the path of one of
the black holes as it is ejected from the DVO.

*** 3.2 Reprogram flight computer

Go aboard the Void Rider and reprogram the flight computer so that it
flies into the path of the next black hole. Along the way one must
find two encryption keys to unlock doors. Here one discovers documents
and logs relating to the failed mission and what happened to Brennan
and the Void Rider after you disappeared. You learn that Brennan may
be alive, in stasis somewhere on the DVO. Furthermore the cosmological
speculations of another crew member hint at manifold
possibilities. After Brennan left for the DVO, the remaining crew ran
out of supplies and starved. But before this happened, there were
glimmers of a way back in time; by traveling in a shuttle along the
trail of black holes left by the DVO, one could reverse time and
travel to the point and time of the object's origin.

*** 3.3 Restore engine power

Reactivate the Void Rider's engines so that the flight computer can
steer it into the path of the black hole, and then escape back to the
DVO.

The DVO fires a black hole, and the Void Rider is destroyed
utterly. 

*** 3.4 Investigate stasis chamber 

The computer gets unusual levels of electromagnetic noise in one spot
on the surface; you are led to a stasis chamber where you discover
Brennan frozen in time. After un-freezing he takes the Black Metal
capsule from his pocket and reveals that the Black Capsule contains
sufficient Black Metal to dominate any new universe formed by the DVO,
and that the hive mind has promised long life and vast powers to those
who advance its cause. After a climactic battle with Brennan, the
Black Capsule falls into the player's hands.

*** 3.5 Destroy black capsule

You take the black capsule to the propulsion lab, where it is disposed
of in a black hole before ejection.

The computer explains that in order to travel back to your own epoch,
you need a much longer trail of black holes to accelerate along. The
computer calculates that you'd need to wait many billions of years, so
you enter a stasis chamber and awaken sometime just before the Heat
Death, into a nearly featureless cosmos. The DVO has decayed
significantly and seems barely able to continue its mission. The
computer itself is tired of consciousness.

You enter a stasis chamber and launch yourself back along the trail of
black holes, slingshotting from one event horizon to another, and
arrive in an unknown area.
