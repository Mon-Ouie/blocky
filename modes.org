#+TITLE: Plan for implementing buffers and major modes in BLOCKY

** TODO list of lines. a line is a list of blocks
** TODO abstract over the lists with a row,col accessor
** TODO change existing editing commands to use row,col abstraction, as far as is necessary


** TODO define the block shell as an embeddable richtext block you can type in, emacs-style
** TODO arrows only nav within object---use control-arrow 
** TODO ??delete only deletes within an object---use control-delete to "break" the text of the previous block?xs?
** TODO attempt to blockify after each spacebar
** TODO forth primitives for accessing blocky
** TODO ROBOT BALL NEW DROP
** TODO DICTIONARY of words. how to define new words
** TODO emulate natural language
** TODO come up with basic scenarios of things to be typed in to make a game
** TODO anything-el-style completion
* TODO forthmode. the stack is composed of blocks, and the current buffer line is the stack!
*** TODO can illustrate, showing execution on successive lines
*** http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ColorForthQuickStart
*** http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language
*** prefix concat: http://sparist.github.com/Om/
*** http://concatenative.org/wiki/view/Concatenative%20language
* TODO http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?ForthMacro
http://grobots.sourceforge.net/
* VISUAL PROGRAMMING WITH THE KEYBOARD. visiprog does not require mouse.
*** dialog boxes are hard. instead use keyboard with auto-completion and suggestions like in emacs.
refactor text buffer widget to allow dynamic inline blockification of plain
english text, by default, new typed characters are in "text widget"
but this can be changed, as well as can the creation parameters for
the current block. like Bold Italic.
** TODO combine features from the Listener and text buffer into an emacsy thing
*** TODO simple concatenative syntax, possibly like Forth. look up colorforth, demo tools
*** TODO Review "THINKING FORTH"
*** TODO somehow incorporate red eevstars / linkdmode 
*** TODO but can add LISP parentheses at any time
** TODO [#B] use a macrolet to allow (next-method -->  (apply (get-next-method) ...)
** TODO [#B] Pretty sexy black rounded corner notifications
**** TODO notifications and a "notify" function 
**** TODO smile/frown emoticon status
**** TODO simple ok notification box
**** TODO generic question dialog box shortcut function
** TODO Review GoF design patterns
** TODO review other .org file ideas in repo
** TODO [#B] buttons for toggle pin,freeze
