This is the INSTALL file for IOFORMS, with instructions on getting
the system installed and running from source.

NOTE: Users of Windows and Mac OSX do not need to follow the
instructions in this file unless they are building IOFORMS from
source code. 

1. System Requirements 

   Linux users will need a Common Lisp implementation---currently
   IOFORMS has only been tested with SBCL (Steel Bank Common
   Lisp). You must also have the SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer)
   libraries installed on your system. How to do this is beyond the
   scope of this document. See http://www.libsdl.org for more
   information.

   Your Linux distribution will have SDL packages for sdl, sdl-image,
   sdl-mixer, and sdl-gfx, all of which are required libraries.

   You will need a working OpenGL implementation and (probably)
   hardware acceleration.

2. If you have not already done so, download IOFORMS:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/ioforms.git 

3. Then link the ioforms.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   mkdir ~/.sbcl
   mkdir ~/.sbcl/systems
   ln -s ~/src/ioforms/ioforms.asd ~/.sbcl/systems/ioforms.asd

4. Install LISPBUILDER-SDL. 
    
    The recommended method is Quicklisp: see http://www.quicklisp.org/
    It takes only a few moments to install Quicklisp. 
    If you don't have Quicklisp, you can follow these instructions.

4a. (OPTIONAL) The latest development version of LISPBUILDER-SDL is
    also available. Use Subversion to check out the source code:

    mkdir ~/src
    cd ~/src
    svn checkout http://lispbuilder.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ lispbuilder

    Then symlink all the .asd files in that tree into ~/.sbcl/systems
    (or wherever your .ASD files go) like this:

    cd ~/.sbcl/systems
    for i in `find ~/src/lispbuilder -name "*.asd"`; do ln -s $i .; done

6. (OPTIONAL) Configure project folders

   The distribution contains a text configuration file called
   IOFORMS.INI; by default the executable looks for it in the same
   directory.

   To run projects, IOFORMS needs a line like this added to the INI
   file so that it will know where to find them.

  (setf ioforms:*project-directories* '(#P"~/ioforms/" #P"~/projects/"))

   The first item should be the pathname of wherever you installed the
   IOFORMS source tree. This is auto-detected as the current directory
   if you don't set it. NOTE: These must be pathnames (prefixed with
   #P) and must contain a trailing slash.

   The other directories should contain game modules. For example:

    mkdir ~/projects
    cd ~/projects
    git clone git://github.com/dto/xong.git

   Now that the example game "XONG" is installed, we're ready to go.

7. At the shell, cd to the install directory for IOFORMS, run SBCL, and
   then issue the following commands at the REPL one by one:

   ;; load dependencies via Quicklisp
    (map nil #'ql:quickload (list "lispbuilder-sdl-mixer" "lispbuilder-sdl-ttf" "lispbuilder-sdl-gfx" "lispbuilder-sdl-image" "cl-opengl") 

    ;; compile and load IOFORMS
    (require :ioforms)

    ;; run the example
    (ioforms:play "example")  ;; or the name of any module in your *module-directories*

7a. If you get an error about TRIVIAL-FEATURES-TESTS, try this:
    (require :trivial-features-tests)
