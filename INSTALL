This is the INSTALL file for Blocky.

This file gives you instructions on how to download Blocky and compile
it from the source code. This should be straightforward on Linux;
Blocky also works on Windows and Mac, but compiling Blocky on those
platforms may require additional steps (such as installing the
included SDL binary DLL's in the included win32/ subfolder of the
Blocky source directory.)

More instructions for Mac and Windows will be available soon.

1. System Requirements for building Blocky (All Platforms)

    - A Common Lisp implementation such as Steel Bank Common Lisp (see
      platform-specific notes below for suggestions on SBCL; CLISP and
      CCL have also been reported to work.)
 
      A recent release from sbcl.org is recommended. Please see:
      http://sbcl.org/platform-table.html

    - A working OpenGL implementation. Hardware acceleration is
      strongly recommended. (Most fairly recent Mac and Windows
      machines will have OpenGL drivers already.)

    - Git, a distributed version control system client.
      http://git-scm.com/

    - (optional) A text editor (preferably Emacs or Vim;
      http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs) If you use Emacs check out
      SLIME (you may need the CVS version) and if you use Vim check
      out SLIMV.

1a. System Requirements (Linux)

   You must have the SDL (Simple Direct Media Layer) libraries
   installed on your system. How to do this is beyond the scope of
   this document. See http://www.libsdl.org for more information.
   Your Linux distribution will most likely have SDL packages for
   sbal, sdl, sdl-image, sdl-mixer, sdl-ttf, and sdl-gfx, all of which
   are required for to compile Blocky. You may also need to install
   the sdl-*-dev packages corresponding to each.

1b. System Requirements (Windows)

   You will need a Windows version of SBCL from http://sbcl.org

1c. System Requirements (Macintosh)

   [THIS SECTION REMAINS TO BE WRITTEN]

2. If you have not already done so, download Blocky:
  
   mkdir ~/src
   cd ~/src
   git clone git://github.com/dto/blocky.git 
   
   (OPTIONAL) If you need to use the development branch of Blocky, do
   this:
  
   cd ~/src/blocky
   git checkout -b develop

   (OPTIONAL) Similarly, if you need a release, use this:

   git checkout -b release/0.989  
     # replace 0.989 with desired version

3. Then link the blocky.asd file into your ~/.sbcl/systems directory:

   mkdir ~/.sbcl
   mkdir ~/.sbcl/systems
   ln -s ~/src/blocky/blocky.asd ~/.sbcl/systems/blocky.asd

4. Install Quicklisp
    
    http://www.quicklisp.org/ It takes only a few moments to install
    Quicklisp, and this is the best way to download and install all
    the Common Lisp libraries that Blocky depends on---automatically.

    After installing quicklisp you will see a notice about adding
    Quicklisp to your Lisp startup file with (ql:add-to-init-file).
    Doing this will make Quicklisp load automatically when you start
    your Lisp implementation.

6. (OPTIONAL) Configure project folders

   By default, new projects are created in ~/.blocky 

   The distribution contains a text configuration file called
   BLOCKY-INIT.LISP; by default Blocky looks for it in the same
   directory as the executable.

   To run projects, Blocky needs a line like this added to the init
   file so that it will know where to find them.

   (setf blocky:*project-directories* '(#P"~/src/blocky/" #P"~/projects/"))

   The first item should be the pathname of wherever you installed the
   Blocky source tree. This is auto-detected as the current directory
   if you don't set it. NOTE: These must be pathnames (prefixed with
   #P) and must contain a trailing slash.

   To use your home directory, 

   (setf *project-directories* (list #P"~/src/blocky/" #P"~/.blocky/" #P"~/"))
   
7. At the shell, 

     cd ~/src/blocky    # or wherever you installed it...
     sbcl       

   Once SBCL is started, enter (or cut and paste) and execute the
   following Lisp expressions one at a time:

      ;; load dependencies via Quicklisp
      (ql:quickload 
    	 '(:lispbuilder-sdl-mixer :lispbuilder-sdl-ttf :lispbuilder-sdl-gfx 
	 :lispbuilder-sdl-image :uuid :cl-opengl :cl-fad))

      ;; compile and load Blocky
      (asdf:load-system :blocky)

      ;; run an example
      (blocky:play "turtle")  ;; A GUI tutorial, with turtle and ladybug

7a.  The work-in-progress game XALCYON is written with Blocky, and can
     be downloaded via git:

      	  git clone git@github.com:dto/xalcyon.blocky.git

      You should put the example somewhere where Blocky's
      *project-directories* setting will find it; your home directory
      is a good candidate if you don't want to change the setup.
      
      Then in SBCL:

          (blocky:play "xalcyon")

8. Getting help and reporting bugs 

   When reporting bugs, please use the issue reporting system at
   Github if possible: https://github.com/dto/blocky/issues

   If not possible or if other questions arise, you can email or IRC
   me as follows:

   dto@ioforms.org 

   You can also try the IRC channel:
   
   irc.freenode.org #blocky
