* TODO fundamental-mode is the basic mode
* TODO rename Worlds to Buffers
* TODO cell mode. spreadsheet
* VISUAL PROGRAMMING WITH THE KEYBOARD. doesn't have to be mouse. 
*** dialog boxes are hard. instead use keyboard with auto-completion and suggestions like in emacs.
refactor text buffer widget to allow dynamic blockification of plain
english text, by default, new typed characters are in "text widget"
but this can be changed, as well as can the creation parameters for
the current block. like Bold Italic.
** TODO combine features from the Listener and text buffer into an emacsy thing
*** TODO try something where you type in natural language commands
*** TODO simple concatenative syntax, possibly like Forth. look up colorforth, demo tools
*** TODO Review "THINKING FORTH"
*** TODO but can add LISP parentheses at any time
*** TODO after each character
** TODO [#B] use a macrolet to allow (next-method -->  (apply (get-next-method) ...)
** TODO [#B] Pretty sexy black rounded corner notifications
**** TODO notifications and a "notify" function 
**** TODO smile/frown emoticon status
**** TODO simple ok notification box
**** TODO generic question dialog box shortcut function
